                The main challenge I had during this assignment was figuring out
                how to use the git desktop app. I have never used it so I am 
                trying to familiarize myself with it. I am doing this my just 
                messing around with it. That also plays into what I learned 
                by doing this assignment. I learned how to use the app a bit. 
                I also learned a little more about how to use html. But I already
                used it before so not much was new. I just had to remember how it
                worked and everything was fine so far. I used some of the links that 
                were provided in the assignment to assist me in creating my pages. 
                I used them to remind myself how html is typed and used.

                The most challenging part of the second assignment was using all the containers 
                and understanding what's the difference between a parent and a child element.
                I can say that I learned how do that in this assignment as well as adding actions to 
                items on the page. The main thing I can say I knew before was how to resize images.
                The most helpful resources were the lecture videos and the internet as a whole. I
                used these resources when I was stuck on how to use different properties for styling. 
                One thing I had to google was how to use the display property.

                This assignment really put my javascript skills to the test and made me learn about it. 
                The hardest part was understanding how to use javascript. I just was rewatching the 
                lectures and other videos online to understand the language. The basics are the best thing 
                I learned from this assignment. I would say I understood the concepts but not the syntax.
                Previously using C++ in other classes helped. The best resources for this assignment were the lecture 
                videos, youtube, and various other javascript websites. One thing I had to google was 
                the syntax of classes and functions.

                I feel like the most challenge part about this assignment was learning exactly how to use node.js and
                undersatnding the server side. Even while trying to complete the assignment, I was struggling a bit. 
                I tried my best by using the lecture notes, recordings, and youtube videos as well. In this assignment 
                I definitely gained some more understanding on the server side. However, I now know that there is much 
                more that I need to learn. A couple things that I had to look up for this assignment were how to use node.js 
                and how handlebars work.
