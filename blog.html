                The main challenge I had during this assignment was figuring out
                how to use the git desktop app. I have never used it so I am 
                trying to familiarize myself with it. I am doing this my just 
                messing around with it. That also plays into what I learned 
                by doing this assignment. I learned how to use the app a bit. 
                I also learned a little more about how to use html. But I already
                used it before so not much was new. I just had to remember how it
                worked and everything was fine so far. I used some of the links that 
                were provided in the assignment to assist me in creating my pages. 
                I used them to remind myself how html is typed and used.

                The most challenging part of the second assignment was using all the containers 
                and understanding what's the difference between a parent and a child element.
                I can say that I learned how do that in this assignment as well as adding actions to 
                items on the page. The main thing I can say I knew before was how to resize images.
                The most helpful resources were the lecture videos and the internet as a whole. I
                used these resources when I was stuck on how to use different properties for styling. 
                One thing I had to google was how to use the display property.
