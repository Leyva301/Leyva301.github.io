                The main challenge I had during this assignment was figuring out
                how to use the git desktop app. I have never used it so I am 
                trying to familiarize myself with it. I am doing this my just 
                messing around with it. That also plays into what I learned 
                by doing this assignment. I learned how to use the app a bit. 
                I also learned a little more about how to use html. But I already
                used it before so not much was new. I just had to remember how it
                worked and everything was fine so far. I used some of the links that 
                were provided in the assignment to assist me in creating my pages. 
                I used them to remind myself how html is typed and used.
