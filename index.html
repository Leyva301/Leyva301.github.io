        <p>I am a 4th year Computer Science Major. The most complex things I have done 
            with my current web development skills are build a basic website. I hope to 
            learn how to build much more complex websites and also how to use JavaScript.
            I do not think that I have signed up for the course Campuswire forum.
            One of my favortite unique experiences was when I went to Puerto Vallarta 
            in Mexico. It was fun since I swam in the ocean, ate Mexican food, and saw
            the different lifestyles in Mexico.
